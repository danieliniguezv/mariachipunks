# Mariachi Punks

Mariachi Punks is an NFT project over at Ethereum Blockchian.

The project consists of a 10 piece traditional Mariachi Band. The artwork 
is composed of 10 digital illustrations depicting the 10 members of the 
band.

# History

The band lost their jobs and gigs due to the recent global crisi (2020). Ever 
since then they had to get side jobs.

Fortunately some of them have already found gigs in the Blockchain.

## NFT

The NFTs have been minted over at OpenSea NFT Market place as ERC-1155 tokens
where 4 of them have been sold already.

The project idea is to mint its own NFTs. And for those who had already bought 
exchange their OpenSea token for a MariachiPunk NFT token (MPK).
